        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          In 2015, I struggled with an illness that severely interfered with my
          ability to work competitively. This illness ultimately leads to the
          need for my resignation in August 2015. After months of recuperation I
          was asked to assist a dear friend and mentor by representing her at a
          Social Security Disability Hearing. Her hearing was awarded favorably
          and my desire to launch IGNiTE GOD’S LITE in January 2016 became a
          reality.
        </p>

        <p>
          A chance meeting with members of the Wounded Warrior program at
          Randolph AFB further catapulted this business adventure. The
          opportunity to assist Wounded Warriors in filing SSDI applications was
          beyond my wildest dreams but soon became my reality. Now, three years
          later I wouldn’t have it any other way. I absolutely LOVE this
          business opportunity, it is completely fulfilling and tremendously
          rewarding.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Wounded Warriors, their spouses and the Recovery Care Coordinators
          have all become my extended family. The United States Wounded Warriors
          are a living testament to strength, honor, faithfulness, sacrifice and
          courage. They display long suffering devotion to uphold the freedoms
          and liberties we Americans often take for granted. The spouses and
          children of these Heroes, are equally worthy of praise for their
          selfless sacrifices on the American Home-front while separated from
          their loves for extended periods of time. In my opinion, whether it be
          the WW Hero, their spouse or children, their sacrifices are rivaled
          only by Jesus Christ’s living sacrifice on the Cross of Calvary over
          2000 years ago.

          <p>
            "During my medical retirement process; I was enrolled into the Air
            Force Wounded Warrior Program for assistance. Through this
            enrollment I was contacted by Mrs. Barbi Law to assist me in filing
            a request for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).
          </p>
          <p>
            In my opinion, Mrs. Law is a subject matter expert regarding the
            process of applying for SSDI. She guided me through the time
            intensive process of gathering the required documents to support the
            claim of disability, filed the claim online, assisted me with forms
            the Social Security Administration sent to clarify the claim of
            disability and acted on my behalf as a liaison with the Social
            Security Administration to ensure all request were answered in a
            timely manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amidst many other responsibilities, Mrs. Law generously volunteers
            her time, knowledge, patience and guidance to the Wounded Warrior
            Program. She demonstrates a sincere devotion in assisting Wounded
            Warriors through the difficult process of requesting SSDI and it was
            a pleasure working with her.
          </p>
          <p>
            I did not want the opportunity to pass without expressing my
            appreciation to Mrs. Law for being instrumental in my being awarded
            monthly disability payments.
          </p>
          <p>
            With deep appreciation.

            "In December I had brain surgery and my case manager recommended
            that I apply for social security and to contact Barbi Law.
          </p>
          <p>
            My husband and I had a few meetings with her and she was nothing but
            extremely friendly and helpful. She would contact the (SSA)
            administration on behalf of me in order to assist with my claim for
            social security benefits. She is very organized and made everything
            very easy by using different stickies and such.
          </p>
          <p>
            It turned out that I was not able to get social security because I
            did not meet the criteria, however, I am still glad that I tried
            because I got to meet Barbi and she is one of the nicest people that
            I have ever met. She is a God sent and my husband and I appreciate
            everything that she had done."

            With a thorough understanding of the Disability system! The best
            part was when we had our phone consults we almost felt like it was
            face to face and you made that time completely dedicated to us
            without rushing. I know my wife appreciated your understanding of
            this being something we are both going through and I appreciated you
            allowing her to be my voice at times. You were amazing at taking the
            time to help us understand and we can not thank you enough for your
            kindness and time!!! You are truly a blessing!!! Thank you!!!"

            "When I was going through the medical retirement process from the
            Air Force, my wife and I did as much research as we could and were
            told that we should apply for SSDI because of my combat-related
            diagnoses and disorders. We were turned down within weeks of
            applying. Having lost all hope regarding the Social Security
            Disability Insurance claim we were at an Air Force Wounded Warrior
            CARE Event when we were instructed to contact Barbi Laws for her
            knowledge and unparalleled help regarding SSDI. We jumped at the
            chance to receive help. My wife contacted Barbi over the phone and
            she agreed to help us after listening to a thorough explanation of
            my disorders and I'm so thankful that she did. Not only did her
            knowledge and effervescent personality help us to navigate the rocky
            layout of the SSA, but she provided us an ear to voice complaints
            and concerns. We would highly recommend using IGNiTE GOD'S LITE, LLC
            when you are attempting to apply for SSDI as we could not be
            happier."

> During my medical retirement process; I was enrolled into the Air Force
> Wounded Warrior Program for assistance. Through this enrollment I was
> contacted by Mrs. Barbi Law to assist me in filing a request for Social
> Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).
>
> In my opinion, Mrs. Law is a subject matter expert regarding the process
> of applying for SSDI. She guided me through the time intensive process of
> gathering the required documents to support the claim of disability, filed
> the claim online, assisted me with forms the Social Security
> Administration sent to clarify the claim of disability and acted on my
> behalf as a liaison with the Social Security Administration to ensure all
> request were answered in a timely manner.
>
> Amidst many other responsibilities, Mrs. Law generously volunteers her
> time, knowledge, patience and guidance to the Wounded Warrior Program. She
> demonstrates a sincere devotion in assisting Wounded Warriors through the
> difficult process of requesting SSDI and it was a pleasure working with
> her.
>
> I did not want the opportunity to pass without expressing my appreciation
> to Mrs. Law for being instrumental in my being awarded monthly disability
> payments.
>
> With deep appreciation.

> In December I had brain surgery and my case manager recommended that I
> apply for social security and to contact Barbi Law.
>
> My husband and I had a few meetings with her and she was nothing but
> extremely friendly and helpful. She would contact the (SSA) administration
> on behalf of me in order to assist with my claim for social security
> benefits. She is very organized and made everything very easy by using
> different stickies and such.
>
> It turned out that I was not able to get social security because I did not
> meet the criteria, however, I am still glad that I tried because I got to
> meet Barbi and she is one of the nicest people that I have ever met. She
> is a God sent and my husband and I appreciate everything that she had
> done."

> My wife and I found you to be so understanding and compassionate. With a
> thorough understanding of the Disability system! The best part was when we
> had our phone consults we almost felt like it was face to face and you
> made that time completely dedicated to us without rushing. I know my wife
> appreciated your understanding of this being something we are both going
> through and I appreciated you allowing her to be my voice at times. You
> were amazing at taking the time to help us understand and we can not thank
> you enough for your kindness and time!!! You are truly a blessing!!! Thank
> you!!!"

> When I was going through the medical retirement process from the Air
> Force, my wife and I did as much research as we could and were told that
> we should apply for SSDI because of my combat-related diagnoses and
> disorders. We were turned down within weeks of applying. Having lost all
> hope regarding the Social Security Disability Insurance claim we were at
> an Air Force Wounded Warrior CARE Event when we were instructed to contact
> Barbi Laws for her knowledge and unparalleled help regarding SSDI. We
> jumped at the chance to receive help. My wife contacted Barbi over the
> phone and she agreed to help us after listening to a thorough explanation
> of my disorders and I'm so thankful that she did. Not only did her
> knowledge and effervescent personality help us to navigate the rocky
> layout of the SSA, but she provided us an ear to voice complaints and
> concerns. We would highly recommend using IGNiTE GOD'S LITE, LLC when you
> are attempting to apply for SSDI as we could not be happier."

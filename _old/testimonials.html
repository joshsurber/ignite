<p><em><img src="images/formplacer.png" alt="military" width="307" height="240" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5"/>"During my medical retirement process; I was enrolled into the Air Force Wounded Warrior Program for assistance. Through this enrollment I was contacted by Mrs. Barbi Law to assist me in filing a request for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).</em></p>
  <p><em>In my opinion, Mrs. Law is a subject matter expert regarding the process of applying for SSDI. She guided me through the time intensive process of gathering the required documents to support the claim of disability, filed the claim online, assisted me with forms the Social Security Administration sent to clarify the claim of disability and acted on my behalf as a liaison with the Social Security Administration to ensure all request were answered in a timely manner.
      </em>
  <p><em>Amidst many other responsibilities, Mrs. Law generously volunteers her time, knowledge, patience and guidance to the Wounded Warrior Program. She demonstrates a sincere devotion in assisting Wounded Warriors through the difficult process of requesting SSDI and it was a pleasure working with her.
        </em>
  <p><em>I did not want the opportunity to pass without expressing my appreciation to Mrs. Law for being instrumental in my being awarded monthly disability payments.
          </em>
  <p><em>With deep appreciation." </em>—Retired Captain USAF

    <em>"In December I had brain surgery and my case manager recommended that I apply for social security and to contact Barbi Law. 
    </em>
  <p><em>My husband and I had a few meetings with her and she was nothing but extremely friendly and helpful. She would contact the (SSA) administration on behalf of me in order to assist with my claim for social security benefits. She is very organized and made everything very easy by using different stickies and such. 
                  </em>
  <p><em> It turned out that I was not able to get social security because I did not meet the criteria, however, I am still glad that I tried because I got to meet Barbi and she is one of the nicest people that I have ever met. She is a God sent and my husband and I appreciate everything that she had done."

  <p><em>&quot;My wife and I  found you to be so understanding and compassionate.&nbsp; With a thorough  understanding of the Disability system!&nbsp; The best part was when we had our  phone consults we almost felt like it was face to face and you made that time  completely dedicated to us without rushing.&nbsp; I know my wife appreciated  your understanding of this being something we are both going through and I  appreciated you allowing her to be my voice at times. You were amazing at  taking the time to help us understand and we can not thank you enough for your  kindness and time!!!&nbsp; You are truly a blessing!!!&nbsp; Thank you!!!&quot;

  <p><em>"When I was going through the medical retirement process from the Air Force, my wife and I did as much research as we could and were told that we should apply for SSDI because of my combat-related diagnoses and disorders. We were turned down within weeks of applying. Having lost all hope regarding the Social Security Disability Insurance claim we were at an Air Force Wounded Warrior CARE Event when we were instructed to contact Barbi Laws for her knowledge and unparalleled help regarding SSDI. We jumped at the chance to receive help. My wife contacted Barbi over the phone and she agreed to help us after listening to a thorough explanation of my disorders and I'm so thankful that she did. Not only did her knowledge and effervescent personality help us to navigate the rocky layout of the SSA, but she provided us an ear to voice complaints and concerns. We would highly recommend using IGNiTE GOD'S LITE, LLC when you are attempting to apply for SSDI as we could not be happier. " </em></p>
